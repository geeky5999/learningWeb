# Dummy

Dummy is a content generation toolkit designed to make the development, testing and presentation of web prototypes less time consuming and more realistic. It does so by making it easy to populate static HTML with dynamic content, and by randomizing elements within a layout on subsequent loads of a document, in a way, simulating connectivity to a live database.

Originally conceived as a tool for helping to simulate the high volume, rapidly changing content characteristics of online news
